Demo of custom widgets loaded as plugin.

Here the Qt embedded widgets are integrated to pvbrowser.
http://qt.nokia.com/qt-in-use/developer/embedded-widget-demos

You have to set
pvb_widget_plugindir=/path/to/pvbaddon/custom_widgets/embedded_widgets/embedded_widgets_1
within your pvbrowser client options.

Then the shared object library with the embedded widgets will be found.
