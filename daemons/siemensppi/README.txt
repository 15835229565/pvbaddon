You can now use pvbaddon/daemons/siemensppi/client/siemensppi_client for data aquistion on Siemens PPI based systems.
siemensppi_client uses an ini file to describe what should be read from PPI.
If you choose siemensppi_client you can access the variables with clear text.

If you don't want to use variables in clear text because of performance issues
you can use PPI with libnodave as supported by the codegenerator
that is integrated into pvdevelop.
