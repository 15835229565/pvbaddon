You can now use pvbaddon/daemons/siemenstcp/client/siemenstcp_client for data aquistion on Siemens TCP based systems.
siemenstcp_client uses an ini file to describe what should be read from the PLC.
If you choose siemenstcp_client you can access the variables with clear text.

If you don't want to use variables in clear text because of performance issues
you can use Siemens TCP as supported by the codegenerator
that is integrated into pvdevelop.
